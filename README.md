# Hyper-Calculus
It's a wbsite that provides math explainatories and visualizations that aims to get bigger and cover larger range of mathematics.

## Dependencies
 At this moment the project is made mainly using `React.js`
 
## Plan for the future
This project is part of larger ambitious project named *Hyper Math*. And at some point in the future there will be a merging between these two projects. \
Hyper Math project will cover all main math topics and will provide a full user experience (with a production backend and front-end and APIs) \

## Contributions
Now I am working on this project alone and that makes it hard to develop the website and add content periodically. So, if you see that you can contribute in the developing of the website or in writing and editing content you can cantact me:\
