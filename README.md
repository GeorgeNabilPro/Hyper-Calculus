# Hyper-Calculus
It's a wbsite that provides math explanations and visualizations in calculus field, With the main goal of making calculus easier to study and to build a repository for calculus topics that makes it easier to find solutions to calculus problems. The project aims to get bigger and cover larger range of mathematics.
 
## Plan for the future
This project is part of larger ambitious project named *Hyper Math*. And at some point in the future there will be a merging between these two projects. \
Hyper Math project will cover all main math topics and will provide a full user experience (with a production backend and front-end and APIs) \

## Contributions
